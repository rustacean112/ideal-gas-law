# ideal-gas-law
Hi :)

This is my second program about chemistry.

This program calculates a type of ideal gas law problem.

It still on developing stage. That means you have to provide 4 infos (until i add another situations):

- Is temp equal or not?
- What is the mass number of first gas?
- What is the mass number of second gas?
- What is the pipe length?

By the way, you are going to need `Fractions` package to run this script. To install `Fractions` package type:
```
pip install Fraction
```
